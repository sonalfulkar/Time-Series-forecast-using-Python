Time series model
The purpose of below code is to understand time series model.

Characteristics of time series model:

It is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesnâ€™t hold true in this case.
Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most TS have some form of seasonality trends, i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame. For example, if you see the sales of a woolen jacket over time, you will invariably find higher sales in winter seasons.
Steps to follow:

Check if time series is stationary with Visual test, statistical test & Augmented Dickey Fuller Test
time series basic forecast:
Naive approach
Moving Average
Simple Exponential Smoothing
Holts Linear model
Holts Winter model
Make time series stationary -

it is critical if we want the forecasting model to work well.

Methods:

a. Differencing: we compute the difference of consecutive terms in the series. Differencing is typically performed to get rid of the varying mean

b. Seasonal Differencing: In seasonal differencing, instead of calculating the difference between consecutive values, we calculate the difference between an observation and a previous observation from the same season

c. Transformation: Transformations are used to stabilize the non-constant variance of a series. Common transformation methods include power transform, square root, and log transform; we will use log transform here

Forecase using ARIMA
